# Store PubMed citation data in a directory that is not version-managed
# because thousands of citation records will be downloaded from NIH's iCite
# and stored in Python modules.
# 
# Be sure to add a __init__.py file to the ./icite directory

# Store records downloaded form PubMed in its own directory for easy access.

# dir_pmids:
# Store files containing longer lists of PMIDs in its own directory.
# Longer lists of PMIDs are downloaded either from the PubMed GUI
# or by running a PubMed query from the dnld_pmids.py script.
#
# dir_icite:
# Store icite information run on a file containing PMIDs in 
# its own directory for easy access.
