## Blurb
Discover sound reasons to consider using the PubMed search tools for your primary scientific literature search engine instead of habitually using Google Scholar (GS).

PubMed has transparent ranking mechanisms, reproducible searches, bulk export, and advanced search interfaces, while GS implements none of these.

## Channels
* **Open Source Toolkit**

## Title
Google Scholar is biomedical scientists' first choice, but it should by PubMed.

## Abstract
Google Scholar (GS) is the number one academic search engine on Earth.  PubMed, popular in biology and chemistry as a source of full-text documents and for its search engine, has a plethora of features recommended for academic search interfaces that GS lacks, but PubMed is missing one important GS feature which attracts academics who are doing a literature search, the \textit{Cited by N} link under each document. This is easily rectified and should be done as soon as possible.
