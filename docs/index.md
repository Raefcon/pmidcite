## [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) ID (PMID) Cite

Augment your PubMed literature search 
from the command-line by linking 
data downloaded from [**NIH's Open Citation Collection (NIH-OCC)**](https://icite.od.nih.gov),
which includes scientific influence, translation, citation counts, and
ranking of a paper among other papers in its co-citation network
using [**PubMed**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) IDs (PMIDs),
rather than clicking and clicking and clicking on
[**Google Scholar**](/doc/images/README_twitter.md)
*Cited by N* links.

### PubMed vs Google Scholar

In 2013, Boeker et al. recommended that a scientific search interface contain five integrated search criteria.
PubMed implements all five, while Google did not in 2013 or today.

Google's highly popular implementation of the forward citation search through their ubiquitous "Cited by N" links
is a "Better" experience than the PubMed's "forward citation search" implementation.

But if your research is in the health sciences and
you are amenable to consider working from the [command line](#command-line-interface-cli),
you can use PubMed in your browser plus
citation data downloaded from the NIH using the command-line  using *pmidcite*.
The NIH's citation data includes a paper's ranking among its co-citation network.

PubMed is a search interface and toolset used to access over 30.5 million article records from databases like:
* **MEDLINE**: a highly selective database started in the 1960s
* **PubMed Central (PMC)**: an open-access database for full-text papers that are free of cost
* Additional content like books and articles published before the 1960s
