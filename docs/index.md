## Welcome to [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) ID (PMID) Cite

from the command-line by linking 
data downloaded from [**NIH's Open Citation Collection (NIH-OCC)**](https://icite.od.nih.gov),
which includes scientific influence, translation, citation counts, and
ranking of a paper among other papers in its co-citation network
using [**PubMed**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) IDs (PMIDs),
rather than clicking and clicking and clicking on
[**Google Scholar**](/doc/images/README_twitter.md)
*Cited by N* links.
